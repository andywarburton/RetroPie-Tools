# RetroPie-Tools

A collection of simple python scripts that I use for cleaning up my RetroPie installation.

* `remove-imageless-roms.py` - (nearly finished) removes roms that do not have any artwork

To run, simply copy the above file to any location on your Raspberry Pi and type:

```sudo python ./remove-imageless-roms.py``` 

Then follow the onscreen instructions!
 
### Coming Soon... ###

* `remove-romless-images.py` - (unstarted) removes images that do not have any roms (for instance when rom has been deleted)

Got a suggestion for a useful script? Please send suggestions via the issues tab!
