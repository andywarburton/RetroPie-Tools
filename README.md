# RetroPie-Tools

A collection of simple python scripts that I use for cleaning up my RetroPie installation!

* `remove-imageless-roms.py` - removes roms that do not have any artwork
* `remove-imageless-roms.py` - removes images that do not have any roms (for instance when rom has been deleted)
* More coming soon!

Got a suggestion for a useful script? Please send suggestions via the issues tab!
